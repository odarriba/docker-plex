# docker-plex
A docker container to run the latest version of Plex Media Server

## Installation

To download the docker container and execute it, simply run:

`sudo docker run -h your_host_name --name plex -d -v /route/to/your/media:/media -v /route/to/your/config:/config -t -i -p 32400:32400 odarriba/plex`

If you don't want to save your configuration outside the docker container, you can omit the `-v /route/to/your/config:/config` variable.

Now you should have a docker instance running `Plex Media Server`.

## First configuration

Due to some network security aspects of Docker, the container is going to be running in a separate subnet, **so you can't really access your Plex server for configuration** (to do it, the server should be in the same network).

**Soltuion:**, you must edit a file called `Preferences.xml` inside your configuration folder. On it you have to add an attribute to the tag `<Preference>`, following this structure: `allowedNetworks="192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0"` (with your own's network configuration).

After making the change you can restart the container and you should be able to access to your Plex Media Server using your web browser (`http://your_server_ip:32400/web`).

## Auto-discovering

Avahi daemon is commonly used to help your computers to find the services provided by a server.

Avahi isn't built into this Docker image because, due to Docker's networking limitations, Avahi can't spread it's messages to announce the services out of the Docker virtual network.

**If you want to enable this feature, you can install Avahi daemon in your host** following this steps (Ubuntu version):

* Install `avahi-daemon`: run `sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon avahi-utils`
* Copy the file from `avahi/nsswitch.conf` to `/etc/nsswitch.conf`
* Copy the service description file from `avahi/plex.service` to `/etc/avahi/services/plex.service`
* Restart Avahi's daemon: `sudo /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon restart`

**But why you need to install this on your host and not in the container?** Because if you don't do it this way, the discovery message won't be able to reach your computers.

## Auto start the service

This repository contains a script to run the container at boot time **in Ubuntu-based distros**, but **it requires that the container have been run manually at least one time**.

To install the script, just execute `sudo cp config/plexmediaserver.conf /etc/init/plexmediaserver.conf`.

* To start the service: `sudo service plexmediaserver start`
* To stop the service: `sudo service plexmediaserver stop`

**Note:** when you stop the service, the container keeps running. Yo must execute `sudo docker stop plex`in order to stop the server.
